# MoneyMine
A game about mining gems and selling them on the market

The goal of this game is to build mines on top of veins of gems to extract resources. As market prices rise and fall, you can buy and sell gems to increase your balance, or hold your gems until prices rise.  
Click a gem tile to build a mine, and click again to upgrade it. Click a wall tile to dig it away and reveal the gems that may be hiding behind it.  
The farther you dig, the more expensive excavation becomes, but the valuable resources you'll find there are worth the expense.
